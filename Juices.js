      <h1>Top Juices to Drink</h1>
        <p>We usually start our day with a nutritious breakfast. Sometimes, though, it may get hard to cook a proper breakfast or sit down and finish a meal in the rush of life, work, daily chores, and routines. This is where the juices come in.</p>

        <p>While juices should not be considered meal replacements, they should be treated as an alternative way of adding vegetables and fruits to your daily diet. Juices, when had in moderation and combinations, especially on an empty stomach, can yield an ample amount of benefits.</p>

        <p>The past few years have brought to light the importance of a strong immune system and of natural foods and remedies to nurse back our health and help fight against viruses, infections, weather changes, and other foreign stimulants. Juicing is not only a sure-shot way of enjoying an antioxidant-rich morning boost of energy, but it also ensures quick digestion and absorption of nutrients in the body.</p>
