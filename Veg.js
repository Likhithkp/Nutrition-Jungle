            <p>Vegetables are one of the most important food groups.</p>
            <p> After all, they provide us with essential vitamins and minerals, phytochemical with antioxidant properties, and fiber that keeps us full and simultaneously feeds our healthy gut bacteriaâ€”which, in turn, helps support our immune system, digestion, and mental health.*</p>

            <p>Plus, researchers say there are likely countless beneficial micro-nutrients in vegetables that we haven't even identified yet!</p>

            <p>But of all the choices out there, from asparagus to zucchini and everything in between, which vegetables pack the most powerful punch for overall health?</p>

            <p>Here, a list of the vegetables that reign supreme, plus what qualities make a vegetable extra healthy in the first place.</p>

            <h2>1. Dark leafy greens</h2>
            <p>Don't underestimate the power of a loaded mixed greens salad.</p>

            <p>Dark leafy greens like kale, spinach, arugula, mustard greens, and Swiss chard are packed with a variety of antioxidants, including carotenoids, which have been shown to protect against free-radical damage.*</p>

            <p>"Just one serving of spinach provides more than half of your vitamin A needs, and it's also a good source of vitamin K, folate, magnesium, and the antioxidants beta-carotene and lutein," says Cording. "It also provides fiber and even 3 grams of protein per serving."</p>

            <p>Pro tip: Cooking kale and spinach is a great way to enhance the bioavailability of its bone-strengthening calcium.*</p>

            <div className='Info'>
              <h2>2. Broccoli</h2>
              <p>Cruciferous veggies contain sulfur-containing phytochemicals called glucosinolates (and their byproduct sulforaphane).</p>

              <p>These sulfur-containing compounds support immune function and normal inflammatory processes and help the body remove toxins through natural detoxification processes of the liver.*</p>

              <p>Research supports that intake of cruciferous vegetables is protective, with one study showing that a drink made with broccoli sprouts activated enzymes in the body that picked up pollutants from the bloodstream and flushed them out via urine.*</p>

              <h2>3. Brussels sprouts</h2>
              <p>"Brussels sprouts are another cruciferous vegetable, and they offer many of the same benefits as broccoli, plus they contain the antioxidant kaempferol1, which has been shown to help counteract cell damage,*" says Cording. "It's also an approachable 'gateway' vegetable for skeptics when it's roasted until crispy."</p>

              <p>In addition to helping us ward off adverse health conditions, Brussels sprouts are chock-full of vitamins, minerals, and fiber.*</p>

              <p>They're particularly high in vitamins A, C, and K, as well as potassium and folate, which makes them a great pick for supporting overall immune function and blood and bone health.*</p>

            <div className='Info'>
              <h2>4. Sea vegetables</h2>
              <p>Although you probably don't even think to eat them, seaweed (nori, kombu, wakame, kelp, dulse, etc.) and other sea veggies such as chlorella (a type of algae) are some of the most nutrient-dense foods you can give to your body.</p>

              <p>Just be mindful not to overdo it, advises Cording, because too much iodine can actually have a negative effect on thyroid health. It's all about balance!</p>

              <p>Chlorella is a powerful chelator, which means it can bind to and remove heavy metals and other toxins that might otherwise tax your liver.*</p>

              <h2>5. Asparagus</h2>
              <p>"Asparagus is rich in folate as well as vitamin K, selenium, and B vitamins like thiamin and riboflavin," says Cording. "It also has been noted for its potential to help support the liver's natural detoxification3 process."</p>

              <p>In fact, asparagus is one of the few dietary sources of glutathione, an antioxidant concentrated in the liver that helps bind toxins and escort them out of the body via urine or bile.</p>

              <p>Sufficient levels of glutathione in the body also help maintain energy, reduce muscle pain, improve sleep quality, and boost immune function.</p>

              <h2>6. Red cabbage</h2>
              <p>Deeply hued veggies are typically a great pick, and red (or purple) cabbage is a prime example.</p>

              <p>In addition to being a good source of vitamin C and fiber, red cabbage contains anthocyanins. "These pigments are powerful antioxidants," says Cording.</p>

              <p>Anthocyanins, a type of flavonoid antioxidant, are found in many foods and plants that appear dark red, purple, or blue in color.</p>

              <p>They support normal inflammatory processes in the body and have been shown to promote heart and brain health, likely due to their ability to combat oxidative stress.</p>

              <h2>7. Butternut squash</h2>
              <p>You can think of butternut squash as an alternative to sweet potatoes (although we really love those too!) while containing many of the same powerful nutrients.</p>

              <p>Butternut squash is a great source of magnesium and potassium, which makes it a top choice for maintaining healthy blood pressure, blood sugar, and a stable mood.</p>

              <p>Research shows8 that beta-carotene, an antioxidant plant pigment, can literally give your skin a natural glow and protect against damaging UV rays9 (but don't skip the sunscreen!) ðŸ˜‚.</p>

              <h2>8. Garlic</h2>
              <p>Garlicâ€”along with onion, leeks, chives, and scallionsâ€”is part of the allium vegetable family, known for its health-boosting organosulfur compounds10, including allicin and diallyl sulfides.</p>

              <h2>9. Red onion</h2>
              <p>"Onions, like garlic, aren't always top of mind when we think of vegetables, but they are a food source of prebiotic fibers to nourish probiotic bacteria in the gut and have been studied for their potential to help fight disease," says Cording.</p>

              <p>Antihistamines are commonly used to treat allergies, so red onions are a worthy salad ingredient for anyone suffering from hay fever.</p>

              <p>They're a rich source of quercetin, a flavonoid antioxidant that's also a natural antihistamine.</p>

              <p>In one older study, participants who ate a breakfast that included a serving of capsaicin-containing red-pepper powder were less likely to snack or even feel hungry before lunchtime.</p>
